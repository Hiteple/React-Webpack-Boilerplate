# React-Webpack-Boilerplate
A little boilerplate to get started with React and Webpack. Handcrafted by me :)

Only one step to get going: once you download the repo run npm install.

npm run dev: opens a tab with a dev-server in development mode.
npm run build: makes a dist folder with optimized code for production.

Feel free to expand the webpack configuration to accept other assets and/or css preprocessors. I didn't because I like to use the styled-components library with React.
